  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) bi-yearly publishes new guidelines on diagnostic 
criteria for physicians to use to diagnose patients with diabetes. More specifically, they primarily use three 
diagnostic criteria: HGBA1C (A1C), fasting blood glucose level (FBG), and an oral glucose tolerance test. These criteria determine who 
is classified as optimistic and pessimistic, who has diabetes, and who does not have diabetes. 
Note that there is a distinction between those diagnosed as pre-diabetic and diabetic, but for this project, 
I lumped this distinction into one class; those diagnosed as pre-diabetic based on laboratory markers are classified as diabetic
